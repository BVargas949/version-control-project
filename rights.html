        <h1>Importance of Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
        <p>IPR protection is potentially very important for innovation, and encourages growth in the global economy,
            suggesting there could be important differences in the relationship between IPR protection and growth
            across countries on their capabilities for innovation and imitation. These rights could potentially cause
            growth in economy and increase value of an idea, so itâ€™s important to know how these rights work.</p>

        <h1>Rights in Relation to Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
        <p><em>Intellectual Property Rights</em> are personal rights. This is important to know because it
            differentiates
            between personal rights and real rights in law. Rights in things, relating to objects, are known as real
            rights. Rights enforceable to a person are known as personal rights. This is important to know that the
            <em>Intellectual Property</em> applies to the person, and not to the object. The relation of the object to
            the
            person is not what is holding the rights under law. The person itself is held under the law. This
            means
            that a person is given obligation to those rights of that object, which are real rights, but the
            interaction with those rights to make them <em>Intellectual Property Rights</em> are personal
            rights, because others
            are affected by a person having rights to the object. There are also the <em>Proprietary Rights</em>
            involved, which
            are rights dependant on a person owning those rights; the relationship between the two. This
            codependent
            relationship of the two subjects is what allows a person to profit from copyright law, should their
            ideas
            or work be stolen. This can be related to proprietary software, which are owned by a company, and
            are usually
            sold to the users instead of being free to use.</p>
