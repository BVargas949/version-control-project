        <h1>About Intellectual Property Rights</h1>

        <p>
            Industrial property rights allows the creator to protect the rights of their product for copying or
            imitation. Some basic and well-known examples that protect industrial property rights are: patents,
            trademarks, registered design. Patents can be used for new an applicable products to protect them from
            being used by others. These protections cannot be void until a period of 20 years after the patent has been
            filed. You can protect the name, brand or symbol of a service with a registered trademark. However, you
            cannot protect service concepts or service ideas, which means that they can be freely copied by your
            competitors (suomi.fi). In other words, industrial rights only protect product ideas, this, however does
            not prevent competitors from copying something after it has been created. In the initial status of the
            patent, there is always the possibility of judicial review, which states that if the patent is deemed
            unlawful, those decisions may be forfeit or revoked. “Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or
            transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts.” (Agreement Treaty on Trade-Related
            aspects of IPR) Private property rights are used for justifying ownership to legal and private property.
            These can also be referred to theoretical ownership. While the term ‘property’ can be considered to be
            extremely extensive, the rights usually don’t expand quite as far. This, precisely is why patents and
            copyrights are often used to ensure ownership over desired property. Without private property rights,
            economy and real estate would exponentially disintegrate into chaos. With this in mind, as economy could
            react erratically, it’s important to realize how this can have an effect on other countries.
